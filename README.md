# 🗺️ Basic Translator

This is a simple application for translating text from one language to another. It is built using Streamlit and the Googletrans library.

## 🧳 Features

- **Easy Text Input:** Add text you wish to translate in a text area.
- **Language Selection:** Choose both the source and destination languages from dropdowns.

And that's pretty much it! It's not finished yet, I will make it more aesthetic later.
